# Library used:

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. PIL
4. Ipython.display
5. tesnserflow
6. matplotlib

# Steps to Execute Code

1. data_preprocessingwithout_extra.ipynb file contains code for getting data from dataset. we do not need to upload dataset but by running the code it will be uploaded in dataframe. So this file is about data preprocessing stage.
2. mlp_model.ipynb file contains code of multi layer perceptron, after getting data from 1st file, it is used here for prediction.
3. Cnn_model.ipynb file contains Cnn model code , which is optimized over MLP model.
